# 💍 `narya`

A CLI tool for managing tasks in the [firefox-ios](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios) repository.

Named after Narya, the Ring of Fire, and one of the three Rings of the Elves, forged by Celebrimbor of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, and later borne by Gandalf.

**NOTE:** This tool is still in **BETA**

## Goals

The goals of this tool are simple:

1. Provide easily reproducible commands for all developers & CI
2. Provide a central place for important utilities used to manage the firefox-ios repo
3. Provide a thoroughly documented, understandable experience that will reduce tribal knowledge

```
⚠️ A fourth possible goal - we're still deciding if this is a goal for the tool:
Provide a simple, indirect way for new developers to discover tooling used in Swift development (eg. swiftlint)
```

Bonus/most important goal: **be dope by being ridiculously helpful**

If a command doesn't materially achieve one of these goals & the bonus goal, it likely shouldn't be part of `narya`

## Installation

`narya` is available through brew.

```bash
brew tap adudenamedruby/narya
brew install narya
```

**NOTE:** installing `narya` will also install several dependencies through `brew`, that are used for firefox-ios:

- [swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Configuration

`narya` uses a `.narya.yaml` file in the firefox-ios repository root for configuration and validation that it's in the correct repository.

For the complete configuration reference, see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md).

### Quick Start

A minimal `.narya.yaml` only needs the required `project` field:

```yaml
project: firefox-ios
```

## Development

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.0+

To use this with the firefox-ios, repo, you will also need the dependencies from that repo.

### Contributing

Contributing to `narya` is easy: please fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR.

### Dev Notes

```bash
# Build
swift build

# Run locally
swift run narya
```

### Testing Notes

Tests use the modern Swift Testing framework (`@Test`, `@Suite`, `#expect`).

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Tests must be run with the `--no-parallel` flag to avoid concurrency issues. Many tests change the current working directory, which is global process state. Running tests in parallel _will_ cause cross-contamination between test suites.

```bash
# Run all tests (must use --no-parallel)
swift test --no-parallel
```

Any new feature or command must include corresponding tests. Tests should cover:

- Command configuration (abstract, discussion text)
- Flag/option validation
- Expected behavior with valid inputs
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Edge cases

See existing test files in `Tests/naryaTests/` for examples.

### Outputting Status from `narya`

All `narya` output is handled by the `Herald`. To maintain clarity between `narya`'s output and the output of tools/commands it wraps, we have a standard way of presenting output.

```swift
static func declare(
    _ message: String,
    asError: Bool = false,
    isNewCommand: Bool = false,
    asConclusion: Bool = false
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `message` - The text to display
- `asError` - Adds 💥 to indicate an error or warning
- `isNewCommand` - Resets state and uses 💍 prefix (use at the start of each command)
- `asConclusion` - Uses 💍 prefix for the final message of a command

**Prefix Logic:**

| Context              | `asError` | Output Prefix |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `isNewCommand: true` | false     | 💍            |
| `isNewCommand: true` | true      | 💍 💥         |
| Continuation         | false     | ▒             |
| Continuation         | true      | ▒ 💥          |
| `asConclusion: true` | false     | 💍            |
| `asConclusion: true` | true      | 💍 💥         |
| After conclusion     | (ignored) | ▒             |

**Multi-line handling:**

- First line of message: uses computed prefix from table above
- Subsequent lines within the same message: always `▒ ▒` (sub-continuation)

**State behavior:**

- `isNewCommand: true` resets all state - use this at the start of each command's `run()` method
- After a conclusion (`asConclusion: true`), subsequent calls use normal `▒` prefix and ignore `asError`/`asConclusion` flags
- Sub-continuation (`▒ ▒`) only applies to lines 2+ within a single multi-line message, not across separate calls

**Example output:**

```
💍 Starting build...
▒ Compiling module A
▒ Compiling module B
▒ 💥 Warning: deprecated API usage
▒ ▒ in file Foo.swift:42
▒ Compiling module C
💍 Build complete!
```

This is produced by:

```swift
Herald.declare("Starting build...", isNewCommand: true)
Herald.declare("Compiling module A")
Herald.declare("Compiling module B")
Herald.declare("Warning: deprecated API usage\nin file Foo.swift:42", asError: true)
Herald.declare("Compiling module C")
Herald.declare("Build complete!", asConclusion: true)
```

#### Raw output

The `Herald` also has a `raw()` function if you need to print out any text. This should almost exclusively be used for the `--expose` command.

### Error Handling

`narya` follows consistent error handling patterns to ensure errors are never silently swallowed and always provide useful context. For detailed guidelines, see [ERROR_HANDLING.md](ERROR_HANDLING.md).

Key principles:

- All custom errors include `underlyingError` when wrapping other errors
- No silent `catch` blocks - errors are always reported via Herald or re-thrown
- Debug logging available via `--debug` flag for troubleshooting

### Debug Logging

Pass the `--debug` flag to any command to enable detailed logging output:

```bash
narya --debug doctor
```

Debug output goes to stderr and includes timestamps, file locations, and underlying error details. This is useful for troubleshooting issues or understanding `narya`'s behavior.

| `narya version`   | Display or update version numbers across the repository      |

#### `bootstrap`

Bootstraps the repository for development. By default, bootstraps the product specified in `.narya.yaml` (`default_bootstrap`), or Firefox if not configured.

#### `build`

Builds Firefox, Focus, or Klar for development using xcodebuild. By default, builds the product specified in `.narya.yaml` (`default_build_product`), or Firefox if not configured.

The simulator is auto-detected to use the latest iOS version with a standard iPhone model (non-Pro, non-Max).

Please read [Simulator Shorthand](#simulator-shorthand) for an explanation of the `--sim` flag.

#### `clean`

Cleans up various cached or generated files.

#### `doctor`

Checks your development environment for required tools and configuration. This is useful for onboarding new developers or troubleshooting build issues.

Checks performed:

- **Required tools**: git, node, npm, swift, xcodebuild, xcode-select, simctl
- **Optional tools**: swiftlint (reports status but won't flag as issue if missing)
- **Repository context** (when run from firefox-ios): validates `.narya.yaml`, checks git hooks installation, shows configured defaults

#### `l10n`

Localization tools for managing XLIFF files and translations between Xcode projects and Mozilla's translation platform (Pontoon). Subcommands:

- `export` - Extract localizable strings from Xcode to XLIFF files in the l10n repository
- `import` - Import translated XLIFF files back into the Xcode project
- `templates` - Create blank template XLIFF files for translators

For `export` and `import`, you must specify either `--product` or `--project-path`:

```bash
# Export Firefox strings (using product preset)
narya l10n export --product firefox --l10n-project-path /path/to/l10n-repo

# Import Focus translations (using product preset)
narya l10n import --product focus --l10n-project-path /path/to/l10n-repo

# Export with explicit project path
narya l10n export --project-path ./Client.xcodeproj --l10n-project-path /path/to/l10n-repo
```

These commands handle locale code mapping between Xcode and Pontoon formats, filtering of non-translatable keys, required translation validation, and comment overrides from `l10n_comments.txt`.

#### `lint`

Runs SwiftLint on the codebase. By default, lints only files changed compared to the main branch.

#### `nimbus`

Manages Nimbus feature flags across the firefox-ios codebase. Subcommands:

- `refresh` - Updates the include block in `nimbus.fml.yaml` with feature files from the `nimbus-features/` directory
- `add` - Creates a new feature with all required boilerplate (YAML file and Swift code)
- `remove` - Removes a feature from all locations

#### `run`

Builds and launches Firefox, Focus, or Klar in the iOS Simulator. This is equivalent to running `narya build` followed by installing and launching the app.

Please read [Simulator Shorthand](#simulator-shorthand) for an explanation of the `--sim` flag.

#### `telemetry`

Updates Glean telemetry configuration files.

#### `test`

Runs tests for Firefox, Focus, or Klar using xcodebuild. By default, runs unit tests for the product specified in `.narya.yaml` (`default_build_product`), or Firefox if not configured.

Test plans available:

- `unit` - Unit tests (default)
- `smoke` - Smoke/UI tests
- `accessibility` (or `a11y`) - Accessibility tests (Firefox only)
- `performance` (or `perf`) - Performance tests (Firefox only)
- `full` - Full functional tests (Focus/Klar only)

Please read [Simulator Shorthand](#simulator-shorthand) for an explanation of the `--sim` flag.

#### `version`

Displays or updates version numbers across the repository. Without options, shows the current version and git SHA.

### Simulator Shorthands

The `--sim` option in `build`, `run`, and `test` subcommands accepts either a shorthand code or the full simulator name (e.g., `--sim 17pro` or `--sim "iPhone 17 Pro"`). Use the `list-sims` subcommand to see available simulators on your current machine and their respective shorthands.

#### Design Principles for Shorthand Patterns

1. Shorthands must be derivable - A user should be able to guess the shorthand from the device name
2. No shorthand is OK - Devices that don't fit the pattern get "-" and require the full name
3. Bidirectional consistency - parseShorthand() and shorthand(for:) use the same rules

In general, these design principles result in the following shorthands on my machine:

iPhone:
| Pattern | Examples | Matches |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| `<N>` | 17 | iPhone 17 (base model only) |
| `<N>pro` | 17pro | iPhone 17 Pro |
| `<N>max` | 17max | iPhone 17 Pro Max |
| `<N>plus` | 16plus | iPhone 16 Plus |
| `<N>e` | 16e | iPhone 16e |
| `se` | se | iPhone SE (any generation) |
| `air` | air | iPhone Air |

iPad:
| Pattern | Examples | Matches |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| `air<size>` | air11, air13 | iPad Air 11/13-inch (13 also matches 12.9) |
| `pro<size>` | pro11, pro13, pro129 | iPad Pro (13 matches 12.9 too; 129 is precise) |
| `mini` | mini | iPad mini (any - but latest) |
| `mini<N>g` | mini6g, mini7g | iPad mini (Nth generation) |
| `miniA<chip>` | miniA17 | iPad mini (A17 Pro) |
| `pad<N>g` | pad10g | iPad (Nth generation) |
| `padA<chip>` | padA16 | iPad (A16) |

Matching behavior precision notes:

- pro13 matches both "13-inch" and "12.9-inch", but prefers exact match if both simulators exist
- pro129 matches only "12.9-inch" (precise)

**NOTE:** Devices that don't fit patterns get "-" and the user must pass in the full name. Matching every device uniquely is not a goal of the shorthand system which is why `--sim` also accepts full names for simulators
